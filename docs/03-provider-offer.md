# Creating Provider, Model and Bid on the Blockchain:

**Needed information (samples):**
* Provider/Owner:   `0x9E26Fea97F7d644BAf62d0e20e4d4b8F836C166c` # Your ERC-20 Wallet with MOR & ETH
* Endpoint:         `server.domain.com:3333` # Internet **publicly accessible** server/node access point 
* Model ID:         `0xe1e6e3e77148d140065ef2cd4fba7f4ae59c90e1639184b6df5c84` # Random 32byte/hex that you generate 
* ipfcCID:          `0xc2d3a5e4f9b7c1a2c8f0b1d5e6c78492fa7bcd34e9a3b9c9e18f25d3be47a1f6` # Another 32byte/hex random for future use
* Model Name:       `CapybaraHermes-v2.5-Mistral-7b` # Human Readable name for the model
* Bid Cost:         `200000000000` (1*10^18 or ~7MOR) # What will the model cost per second to use

## Steps
1. To complete these steps, you will need to be running the proxy-router and also have access to the API Port (default=8082)for the Swagger API Interface
    1. http://localhost:8082/swagger/index.html

1. Authorize Diamond Contract to spend on the Provider's behalf 
    1. http://localhost:8082/swagger/index.html#/transactions/post_blockchain_approve 
    1. Spender Address = Diamond Contract 
    1. Authorized Amount = remember that this is in the form `1*10^18` so make sure there's enough MOR granted to cover the contract fees 
    1. The Diamond Contract is now authorized to spend MOR on provider's behalf 

1. Create Provider in the Diamond contract via swagger api:
    1. Start proxy-router 
    1. http://localhost:8082/swagger/index.html#/providers/post_blockchain_providers
    1. Enter required fields:   
        1. addStake = Amount of stake for provider to risk - Stake can be 0 now 
        1. Endpoint = Your **publicly accessible endpoint** for the proxy-router provider (ip:port or fqdn:port no protocol) eg: `mycoolmornode.domain.com:3333`

1. Create Model in the contract:
    1. Go to http://localhost:8082/swagger/index.html#/models/post_blockchain_models and enter
        1. modelId: random 32byte/hex that will uniquely identify model (uuid)
        1. ipfsCID: another random32byte/hex for future use (model library)
        1. Fee: fee for the model usage
        1. addStake: stake for model usage 
        1. Owner: Provider Wallet Address 
        1. name: Human Readable model like "Llama 2.0" or "Mistral 2.5" or "Collective Cognition 1.1" 
        1. tags: array of tag strings for the model 
        1. Capture the `modelID` from the JSON response 
            **NOTE** The returned `modelID` is a combination of your requested modelID and your providerID and will be required to update your models-config.json file AND when offering bids

1. Update the models-config.json file with the new modelID and restart the proxy-router
    1. Navigate to the proxy-router directory and open the `models-config.json` file
    1. Add the new modelID to the JSON array of models
    1. Save the file and restart the proxy-router

1. Offer Model Bid in the contract: 
    1. Navigate to http://localhost:8082/swagger/index.html#/bids/post_blockchain_bids and enter
        1. modelID: Model ID Created in last step: 
        1. pricePerSecond: this is in 1*10^18 format so 100000000000 should make 5 minutes for the session around 37.5 MOR 
        1. Click Execute
