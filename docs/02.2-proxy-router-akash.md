# Proxy-Router Container on AKASH: 

**This document describes setting up the proxy-router component of the Morpheus AI Network in a Docker container hosted on AKASH ONLY and accessing it via the Swagger API Interface...no GUI or Wallet components are included in this setup**

## Pre-Requisites: 
* Your AI model has been configured, started and made available to the proxy-router server via a private endpoint (IP:PORT or DNS:PORT) eg: `http://mycoolaimodel.domain.com:8080`
* You have an existing funded wallet with MOR and ETH and also have the `private key` for the wallet (this will be needed for the .env file configuration)
* You have an Akash account and are familiar with deploying containers on the Akash network (including wallet, tokens and deployment approaches)
* **NOTE with Akash,** the full endpoint will not be available until you've selected a provider and then deployed your proxy-router, so there will be a few follow up steps on Provider Registration on the blockchain and updating the API URL after the deployment

## Key Environment Variables for ephemeral instances on Akash: 
* A typical proxy-router installation on a full server or normal container service usually requires a referenced .env file and a network volume for control files like models-config.json, rating-config.json, proxy.conf, and .cookie file.
* In our testing, the external volume creation and accessibility on Akash was not as stable or reliable as we would like, so we have opted to use environment variables for the key configuration settings like pre-setting the .cookie file (username and password for the API) and the hosted models.
* The new variables to use for this will be: 
    - Cookie_content is used to "pre-seed" the .cookie file with specified username and password,
        - `COOKIE_CONTENT=admin:password`
    - Models_Config_Content is used for ephemeral or streamlined deployment with containers using a flattened version of the typical models-config.json file.
        - `MODELS_CONFIG_CONTENT={"$schema":"./internal/config/models-config-schema.json","models":[{"modelId":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","modelName":"llama2","apiType":"openai","apiUrl":"http://localhost:8080/v1"},{"modelId":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","modelName":"inference.sdxl.txt2img.v1","apiType":"prodia-v2","apiUrl":"https://inference.prodia.com/v2","apiKey":"FILL_ME_IN"}]}`

## PREPARE the SDL Template:
1. In local file editor, download and customize the provided [Akash SDL Template](./02.2-proxy-router-akash.yml) 
1. Container/Image Compatibility Note: 
    * Currently only version `2.2.50-dev` and higher in the dev branch has the Akash compatibility 
    * This feature will be available in final release version `2.3.0` expected release in mid-Feburary 2025
1. Update the variables with your specific configuration
    * WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY: Your wallet private key
    * COOKIE_CONTENT: The username and password for the API
    * MODELS_CONFIG_CONTENT: The models configuration for the proxy-router
1. The current blockchain (Contract / Token / BlockScout are set for MAINNET, but can be updated for TESTNET)
1. Verify the Akash specific details such as: 
    * Container sizing - CPU, Memory, Storage and Port mappings
    * Pricing, Placement and Deployment settings
1. Save (securely...as it has your models and private key) the file.

## Deploy the Proxy-Router on Akash:
1. From your Akash Dashboard, select `DEPLOY` and then `Custom Container`
1. Name your deployment and click the `Upload your SDL` button
1. Select the SDL file you customized and click `Create Deployment`
1. Walk through the Akash deployment steps, select your provider and launch 
1. Ensure that your proxy-router has launched successfully and is running
    * From the Deployment console, click your Proxy-Router deployment 
    * Examine the Events and Logs to ensure the container is running and the API is accessible

## Post-Deployment Steps:
1. Update `WEB_PUBLIC_URL` with provider specific url and port 
    1. Before using the API, you will need to update the  in the deployment configuration to match your selected providers url and published port
    
    ![akash_port_list](/docs/images/akash_port_list.png)
    
    1. Examine your Leases for that container, you should see the Forwarded ports 
    1. Hover over the first one and note the referenced url, this is the public endpoint for your proxy-router
        - eg: http://provider.akashrulez.xyz
    1. You will also see which public ports were assigned to your API endpoint 
        - eg: `8082:32087` 
    1. Also capture the proxy-router port and it's public port (we'll use that in provider update later)
        - eg: `3333:31201` 
    1. Click the `Update` button on the deployment and update the `WEB_PUBLIC_URL` with the noted url and port 
        - eg: `WEB_PUBLIC_URL=http://provider.akashrulez.xyz:32087`
    1. Click `Update Deployment` and wait for the changes to be applied (Check Events and Logs to confirm)

1. Update your `Registered provider` on the blockchain with the new host URL and port 
    1. If you followed the steps above, you should now be able to connect to your API Swagger interface 
        eg: http://provider.akashrulez.xyz:32087/swagger/index.html 
    1. Authenticate using the pre-seeded `COOKIE_CONTENT` username and password using the green `Authorize` button
    1. Go to the Providers section and select `POST /blockchain/providers` and click `Try it out`
    1. Update the endpoint with the url (no protocol prefix) and port (not the API port..but the other proxy-router port) and your current provider stake
    ```json 
    {
      "endpoint": "provider.akashrulez.xyz:31201",
      "stake": "123000000000"
    }
    ```
    1. Click execute and verify the response is successful
    1. You should now see your provider listed in the blockchain providers list with the proper Akash hosted endpoint 
        * use the `GET /blockchain/providers` to verify your provider is listed properly
